# 16-bit MIPS Processor

This project implements a 16-bit MIPS processor using VHDL. The design includes various components such as an ALU, control units, program counter, memory modules, and a register file. The processor is capable of executing a basic set of instructions and is tested using a testbench.

## overview

The MIPS processor implemented in this project is designed to execute a subset of the MIPS instruction set. The project includes the following components:

Main MIPS processor
Control Unit
RAM
ROM
Register File
ALU
